[Statically v. dynamically v. strongly v. weakly typed languages](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/statically-v-dynamically-v-strongly-v-weakly-typed-languages)

Definitions
* Statically-typed programming languages do type checking (i.e., the process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types on values) at compile-time
* dynamically-typed languages do type checks at runtime.
* Weakly-typed languages make conversions between unrelated types implicitly;
* strongly-typed languages donâ€™t allow implicit conversions between unrelated types.

Examples
* Statically-typed: C, C++, Java.
* Dynamically-typed: Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript.
* Python is a strongly-typed language:
* JavaScript is a weakly-typed language:
