Q: [ .NET C# docs are always harder to understand than other languages docs like Java or PHP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/li8gjg/is_it_me_or_microsoft_docs_are_bad_or_hard_to_read/)

A: I guess it comes down to a few things, two things in particular I have noticed: It's meant to be a reference not a guide - i.e. like a thesaurus where you look up a word, there is a short definition and 1-2 example sentences, but not much other context. It's all over the place: seriously, you know there is something wrong where the page you are at links to a completely different page with the same name, that explains the same thing but in a completely different way - and then you find a third one which is like a tutorial of the same thing, and so on. I know there is a reason behind all this, but it does come across as poorly organized.
